In this post I will be going over how I got my first real project, the challenges it entailed and how I approached them, I will also include some of the development decisions I took over the course of the project, the mistakes, and the things I've ultimately learnt.

On a side note: I have always cherished transparency, and I hold great respect to those who offer their own personal experiences for everyone to read and learn from, because this is how I learnt, it's a never ending cycle of giving that nourishes everybody, a cycle that gets extinguished when one refuses to pass on the baton he was entrusted with.

As such, I would like this post to convey my experience as transparently as possible, hoping that it might help someone who stumbles upon it and also for the sheer value of documenting a memorable experience of mine.
