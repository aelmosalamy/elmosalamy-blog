This opens up room for what I call "CISO fraud", incompetent people with 0 knowledge about cybersecurity - from a technical point of view - who get by just about right, maneuvering through ranks and speaking like authorities.

Of course, this is justified by saying that cybersecurity is more business tha....

This does not mean cybersecurity is useless; instead, cybersecurity remains:
- Extremely difficult
- Extremely fun
- Extremely rewarding both financially and intellectually.
- Cybersecurity can save lives, rarely
