      <description>In this post, I am going to introduce you to an interesting Python framework&amp;hellip;&#xA;The popular web development microframework: Flask.&#xA;A framework basically controls how your code is built and deployed. A framework isn&amp;rsquo;t a library. Your code calls library functions and methods; on the other hand, A framework calls your code and deploys it.&#xA;Flask is called a microframework because it is considered low-level compared to other web frameworks like Django; Flask provides you with the core functions and its up to you how you combine them together to create larger applications, This makes Flask very versatile and extensible.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s up everybody! In this post I am going to show you an interesting tip which I rarely see young Pythonistas use, it&amp;rsquo;s List Comprehensions. If you dabbled a little with Python you probably had some problems where you had to iterate over a list and perform functions to its elements on-the-run, I know. I make no sense. To clear things up let me start with a simple task. Given a list of numbers, return a list containing the squares of the original list&amp;rsquo;s numbers, You might think: &amp;ldquo;Well, That&amp;rsquo;s easy!</description>
