      <description>Hello everyone,&#xA;Recently, while watching a video, I came across a guy using Linux on his machine, It looked really clean and neat and I wanted to try it!&#xA;At the start it just looked cool and I thought why not download it? It is free and open-source. I looked up for Linux and found it have what is known as &amp;ldquo;distros&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Basically distros or distributions are a different variations of Linux, with every distro having its own look and settings - think of it as ice cream flavours - It can be different File manager or different interface, terminal and so on.</description>
