      <description>In this post I will be going over how I got my first real project, the challenges it entailed and how I approached them, I will also include some of the development decisions I took over the course of the project, the mistakes, and the things I&amp;rsquo;ve ultimately learnt.
On a side note: I have always cherished transparency, and I hold great respect to those who offer their own personal experiences for everyone to read and learn from, because this is how I learnt, it&amp;rsquo;s a never ending cycle of giving that nourishes everybody, a cycle that gets extinguished when one refuses to pass on the baton he was entrusted with.</description>
