      <description>In this post, I am going to introduce you to an interesting Python framework&amp;hellip;&#xA;The popular web development microframework: Flask.&#xA;A framework basically controls how your code is built and deployed. A framework isn&amp;rsquo;t a library. Your code calls library functions and methods; on the other hand, A framework calls your code and deploys it.&#xA;Flask is called a microframework because it is considered low-level compared to other web frameworks like Django; Flask provides you with the core functions and its up to you how you combine them together to create larger applications, This makes Flask very versatile and extensible.</description>
