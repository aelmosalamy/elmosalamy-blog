      <description>In this post I will show you a very interesting challenge that came up in the recent GPN 2024 CTF.&#xA;The challenge is called Secure Notes and is authored by @13x1.&#xA;We are provided with an extremely short source (exactly 16 lines!), but before you get excited, this challenge had the least solves by a margin despite its conciseness. In fact, for over 36 hours, only five teams were able to solve it.</description>
