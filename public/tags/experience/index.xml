      <description>I started on the 21st of August 2019, It took me 321 days which is equivalent to 10 month and 16 days to run through the whole freeCodeCamp curriculum, It was a great journey, well worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s kinda longer than it should&amp;rsquo;ve been, but I had some obstacles i.e. examinations along the way and I followed a strategy of intermittent learning, where I would do challenges for a couple of days then stop and follow a tutorial/build a project on the same topic for another couple of days, so I was actually learning a lot outside FCC, now a couple of you people on track or coming recently to FCC might be wondering: &amp;ldquo;How exactly did freeCodeCamp help you?</description>
