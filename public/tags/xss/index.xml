      <description>In this post, we will learn about text encoding, how browsers determine content encoding, talk about BOM and finally how we can bypass DOM sanitizers by just playing around with input encoding.&#xA;For those interested, this post is based on an interesting challenge called Secure Notes which was authored by @13x1 and have appeared in the recent GPN 2024 CTF.&#xA;We are given 16 lines of source code and access to an admin bot.</description>
