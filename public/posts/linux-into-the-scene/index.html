Recently, while watching a video, I came across a guy using Linux on his machine, It looked really clean and neat and I wanted to try it!
At the start it just looked cool and I thought why not download it? It is free and open-source. I looked up for Linux and found it have what is known as &amp;ldquo;distros&amp;rdquo;.
Basically distros or distributions are a different variations of Linux, with every distro having its own look and settings - think of it as ice cream flavours - It can be different File manager or different interface, terminal and so on." />

        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Recently, while watching a video, I came across a guy using Linux on his machine, It looked really clean and neat and I wanted to try it!</p>
<p>At the start it just looked cool and I thought why not download it? It is free and open-source. I looked up for Linux and found it have what is known as &ldquo;distros&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basically distros or distributions are a different variations of Linux, with every distro having its own look and settings - think of it as ice cream flavours - It can be different File manager or different interface, terminal and so on. I searched for the most popular distros - I wanted something solid with a big community - and I came across Ubuntu, a quick glance at its interface and I loved it instantly!</p>

<p>So I went to the Ubuntu website and downloaded the latest LTS release, then&hellip;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how to install it, I never installed an operating system myself. After some research, I realized I have to dual-boot - Installing two systems and become able to choose between them - Windows with Ubuntu, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to do that, I saw many videos and tutorials and it looked easy; however, I was kinda scared. scared I might mess something up and I end up with a corrupt disk, computer doesn&rsquo;t boot properly, or anything you can imagine when you think of playing around with operating systems.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to try and do it anyway, It changed from being just a personal preference to a must-do-this challenge. Now that I&rsquo;ve done it, I can tell you it was pretty easy and straightforward, and it unlikely - If you follow the instructions - to mess anything up.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what I did to dual-boot Ubuntu with my Windows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download the ISO file for Ubuntu&rsquo;s long-term-support release from their website.</li>
<li>Use Windows' Disk Management utility to partition my hard drive, I made a 800 GBs partition for my files and another 200 GBs empty partition for Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Insert a USB Flash drive (The data on it will be deleted so make sure you don&rsquo;t need them) and format it, make sure to use FAT32 filesystem.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html">Rufus</a>  and open it, give it your downloaded ISO file, specify your USB location and press &ldquo;Start&rdquo;, it will take 3-5 mins to create your Bootable USB, close Rufus when done.</li>
<li>Open the &ldquo;Change advanced startup options&rdquo; on your Windows - on Windows 10, you can find it by searching &ldquo;boot&rdquo; - then click on &ldquo;Restart&rdquo; under &ldquo;Advanced startup options&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Boot from USB . . .&rdquo; option.</li>
<li>After few seconds a black loading screen saying &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo; will appear and prompt you &ldquo;Try Ubuntu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Install Ubuntu&rdquo;, I recommend trying it so you can decide whether you like it - which is very likely - or you gonna think about it.</li>
<li>If you are going to &ldquo;Install Ubuntu&rdquo; then you will run through a straightforward wizard setting up your partitions, setting your computer name, users, location and time, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>Now you can use your new OS, every time you power up your computer a Boot Loader program called GRUB will give you choices you can then select either Ubuntu or Windows.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You can access your Windows file from Ubuntu and not vice versa, Ubuntu supports the NTFS filesystem (The one Window&rsquo;s use) while Windows need some special software so it can read the exFAT filesystem Ubuntu use (Another try by Microsoft to stay dominating I guess).</p>

<p><strong>Customizing Ubuntu:</strong></p>
<p>Ubuntu and Linux generally are known for their versatility, theoretically you can customize everything in Linux, ranging as high as the graphical interface and as deep as your system&rsquo;s kernel. There is plenty of beautiful themes available for download, one of my favorite themes is the <em>X Arc Dark</em> which is part of the <em>X Arc Collection,</em> you can download it <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1167049/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You need to download the GNOME Tweaks tool which is found at Ubuntu&rsquo;s Software Center, using this you will be able to change themes (You gotta search for yourself how to apply the <em>X Arc</em> themes though, additionally this tool gives you many options to &ldquo;tweak&rdquo; and customize your system, surely it is a must-have.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
<p>Ubuntu comes with a preinstalled office alternatives, LibreOffice, which is nothing fancy, it has all the necessary features you would expect from Word, Excel and Powerpoint.</p>
<p>I downloaded the following free software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinta instead of MS Paint</li>
<li>GIMP instead of Photoshop</li>
<li>Inkscape instead of Illustrator</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Blender3D</li>
<li>VLC Media Player (is a must)</li>
<li>Kazam screen-recorder (I was planning to record some tuts)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basic, yet great FOSS bundle.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>I loved Ubuntu, it got that great look and feeling, it is solid and stable and you can customize everything to your liking, it was a great experience, I learned a lot just from the installation process.</p>
<p>I was able to test ASCII Combat on UNIX systems (And fixed one little bug too) also I planning to get into is: Shell-scripting which is amazing if you want to get your hands dirty with servers, who knows maybe I can become a sysadmin? (Nah, just kidding :P).</p>
