        <p>In this post I will be going over how I got my first real project, the challenges it entailed and how I approached them, I will also include some of the development decisions I took over the course of the project, the mistakes, and the things I&rsquo;ve ultimately learnt.</p>
<p>On a side note: I have always cherished transparency, and I hold great respect to those who offer their own personal experiences for everyone to read and learn from, because this is how I learnt, it&rsquo;s a never ending cycle of giving that nourishes everybody, a cycle that gets extinguished when one refuses to pass on the baton he was entrusted with.</p>
<p>As such, I would like this post to convey my experience as transparently as possible, hoping that it might help someone who stumbles upon it and also for the sheer value of documenting a memorable experience of mine.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-began">How it began<a href="#how-it-began" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>It was on July 6th, 2020 that I completed <a href="/posts/tribute-for-freecodecamp/">freeCodeCamp&rsquo;s Full Stack curriculum</a>, and was wondering: what now? I had a vague
I knew that I had the basic tools already, I&rsquo;ve even built several mini practice projects; however, none of them is a &ldquo;project&rdquo; per se, they were proofs of concept at best, which I&rsquo;ve built to supplement my learning process and help me digest some of the harder concepts I came across.</p>
<p>So with that in mind,</p>
